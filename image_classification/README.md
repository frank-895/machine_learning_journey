# Image Multiclass Classification - Estonian Mushrooms 🍄‍🟫🍄‍🟫🍄‍🟫
We will be entering this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mushroom-multiclass-classification), which is a multiclass image classification project on Estonian mushrooms. The aim is to predict the type of mushroom to improve public safety and knowledge.

This project is an iterative approach to deep learning and I intend on trying a few different models to put forward multiple submissions.

The mushrooms are labelled 0-9 and each number corresponds to the following mushroom type:

0. amanita
1. boletus
2. chantelle
3. deterrimus
4. rufus
5. torminosus
6. aurantiacum
7. procera
8. involutus
9. russula

We have 300 images for each category - 3000 images in total.

## Overview

## Results

## Key Learnings
- **Power of iteration**: By using smaller models to gauge the most appropriate settings, data augmentation, and hyperparameters, we could quickly iterate. Then, once the best settings were found, we were able to finalise and maximise our results on a larger model. 
- **Test time augmentation**:
