# My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my machine learning journey! This contains all my work and notes from the FastAI course among other sources. Each lesson folder includes the Jupyter notebooks and detailed explanations.

## Table of Contents

- [Image Classification](https://github.com/frank-895/pasta_detector): Introduction to Image Classification (standalone project using `fastai`) by creating simple web application to classify pasta types.
- [Manual Creation of a NN](./manual_creation_of_NN): Understanding Linear Learner Models and Neural Networks by Classifying the MNIST Dataset, manually creating a NN. 
- [NLP Classification](./NLP_classification): Using NLP classification to perform phrase to phrase matching for the US patent office.
- [Titanic Dataset](./titanic_dataset): Demonstrated the process of building a deep learning model from scratch by predicting survival using the Titanic dataset. Performed the same task using pretrained models and more advanced techniques.

## Credits

This code is based on code provided by the fastai course, especially a number of Kaggle notebooks accessible through their website: https://www.fast.ai.
The FastAI team has provided tools and resources that helped in developing this work.
I have adapted the code and content to demonstrate my own learning and to help others!
