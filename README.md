# My Machine Learning Journey ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

Welcome to my machine learning journey! This contains all my work and notes from the FastAI course among other sources. Each lesson folder includes the Jupyter notebooks which are my personal notes and experimentation based on the course material. I find that explaining the course material in my own words helps with my own understanding, and maybe it can also help others!

## Table of Contents

- [Image Classification](https://github.com/frank-895/pasta_detector): Introduction to Image Classification (standalone project using `fastai`) by creating a simple web application to classify pasta types.
- [Manual Creation of a NN](./manual_creation_of_NN): Understanding Linear Learner Models and Neural Networks by Classifying the MNIST Dataset, manually creating a NN. 
- [NLP Classification](./NLP_classification): Using NLP classification to perform phrase-to-phrase matching for the US patent office.
- [Titanic Dataset](./titanic_dataset): Demonstrated the process of building a deep learning model from scratch by predicting survival using the Titanic dataset. Performed the same task using pretrained models and more advanced techniques.
- [Predict Sticker Sales](./predict_sticker_sales): My first machine learning Kaggle competition, using sales data to create a model that can predict future global sticker sales.
- [Random Forests](./random_forests): Using binary splits, decision trees and finally random forests in a Kaggle competition about a mythical interstellar Titanic disaster.
- [Gradient Boosting Machines](./gradient_boosting_machine): Using ensembles of decision trees, including random forests and gradient boosting machines, the Kaggle sticker competition was reattempted.
- [Collaborative Filtering](./collaborative_filtering): Built a collaborative filtering model for movie recommendations from scratch using PyTorch.
- [Gradient Accumulation & Ensembling](./gradient_accum_ensembling): Used Hugging Face and NLP to predict if a tweet was talking about a real disaster or not. Learned gradient accumulation and how to ensemble larger pretrained deep learning models.

## Credits

This code is based on code provided by the fastai course, especially a number of Kaggle notebooks accessible through their website: https://www.fast.ai.
The FastAI team has provided tools and resources that helped in developing this work.
I have adapted the code and content to demonstrate my own learning and to help others!
