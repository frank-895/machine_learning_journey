# Ethics in Data Science

## Overview
These are my notes about data science ethics, an area I consider important especially when studying groundbreaking technologies like machine learning.

These notes are from the FastAI bonus chapter on ethics, specifically this YouTube Video: [Ethics for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krIVOb23EH8).

This notebook focuses on current ethical dilemmas surrounding data science - not future ethical problems. While technology has a done a lot of good for the world, it has and continues to cause significant harm.

## Topics Covered
- **What is Ethics?**
  - Consequentialism & Deontology
  - Ethical lenses in AI decision-making

- **Why Ethics in Data Science Matters**
  - Historical examples of harm caused by technology (e.g., data collection in genocides)

- **Challenges in Ethical AI Development**
  - The impact of speed and hypergrowth
  - The risks of over-relying on metrics (Goodhartâ€™s Law)
  - Feedback loops and echo chambers in AI models

- **Bias in AI**
  - Gender, racial, and historical bias
  - Measurement bias and its consequences

- **Disinformation & AI**
  - AI-generated content and large-scale manipulation
  - The role of technology in amplifying misinformation

- **Diversity & Inclusion in AI**
  - Why diverse teams lead to better ethical decisions

- **What Engineers Can Do**
  - Ethical risk assessments
  - Accountability in AI development
  - Best practices for responsible AI design
 
## Key Learnings
While AI has immense potential for good, it also poses significant ethical risks. As engineers and data scientists, we have a responsibility to build technology for good. This repository serves as a resource for ongoing reflection and discussion on how we can create AI systems that benefit society rather than harm it.
